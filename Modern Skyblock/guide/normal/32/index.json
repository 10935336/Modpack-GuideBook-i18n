  "UU-Matter is a material that can be shaped to make anything in vanilla Minecraft and Tech Reborn. Making it however, isn't all that easy. You first need Iridium which can be made in an Induction Smelter with Platinum Ore and Cinnabar, which is made by crushing Gold Ore. Once you have that, you are able to make a Matter Fabricator. The Matter Fabricator uses Scrap made in the Recycler to slowly create UU-Matter. You need a large amount of Scrap to create only 1 piece of UU-Matter, so you'll probably want to automte its creation."
