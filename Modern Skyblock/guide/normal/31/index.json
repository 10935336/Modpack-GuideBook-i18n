  "To start off with Mekanism, you'll need to make Metallurgic Infuser. It can be used to make Circuits more efficiently, but the main reason why you need it however, is for making Enriched, Reinforced and Atomic Alloys, which are used for making just about every machine in this mod.",

  "The machines that you will need in order to progress trough the pack are: the Chemical Oxidizer, which can be used for turning certain materials into fluids; the Rotary Condensentrator, which can turn gases into liquids and vise versa; the Electrolytic Separator, which can be used for separating a fluid into 2 other fluids; the Chemical Infuser, which combines 2 fluids into 1 fluid; the Chemical Dissolution Chamber, which can be used for turning Ores into Slurries; the Chemical Washer, which can be used for cleaning Slurries; and the Chemical Crystallizer, which be used for turning Slurries into Crystals."
