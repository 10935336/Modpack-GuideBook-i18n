  "To start off with Industrial Foregoing, you will need Plastic. To make Plastic, you are going to need a Tree Fluid Extractor, which extracts Latex from Logs, but slowly breaks them, and a Latex Processing Unit, which combines Latex, Water and power to create Tiny Dry Rubber, used to make Plastic. Plastic can also be used as a substitute for Rubber, so you could replace your Rubber Tree farm with a few of these setups if you wanted to. For more information, you can craft Industrial Foregoing's Manual.",

  "Industrial Foregoing is for the most part a recreation of MineFactory:Reloaded, if you've ever played with that mod. It allows you to automate enchanting and farms. Some of its machines create Sludge, which can be turned into some useful early-game resources or into fertilizer. For the late-game, it has a Material StoneWork Factory, which generates Cobblestone and can process it (crush, smelt or craft it in a 2x2 or 3x3) up to 4 times, allowing you to create Glass, Polished Stone, Quadruple Compressed Cobblestone and many other materials in a single block. It even works much faster than the machines that are used to craft it. Another late-game machine is the Laser Drill, which collects ores from the void.",

  "Later on, to make Empowered Emeradic Crystals, you will need Essence, which is produced in the Mob Crusher and Resourceful Furnace. It can also be used in the Mob Duplicator."
