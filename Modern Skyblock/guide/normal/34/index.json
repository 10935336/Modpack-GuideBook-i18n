  "The first reactor is the Fission Reactor from NuclearCraft. The main things it requires are: Graphite, made in the Manufactory, Rhodocrosite, obtained from mining Redstone Ore, Beryllium, obtained from mining Coal Ore and Zirconium, obtained from mining Nether Quartz Ore. To make the reactor, you can follow JEI.",
