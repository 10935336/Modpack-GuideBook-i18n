  "Once you have a decent amount of Draconium, you will want to upgrade it to Wyvern tier. The next Step is to kill the Ender Dragon a couple of times to obtain a good amount of Dragon Hearts. With them you'll be able to make Awakened Draconium for Draconic Tier items and blocks, as well as a maximum sized Draconic Energy Orb. For more information, you can craft an Information Tablet. Once you're all geared up, you can take on the Chaos Dragons and obtain Chaos Shards for upgrading everything to Chaos Tier."
