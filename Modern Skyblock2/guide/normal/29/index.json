  "In order to start off with Thermal Expansion, you need to progress through Embers. For more information about the mod, you should make an Ancient Codex. To start off, you need to make a couple of Ember Shards and an Ember Activator. By feeding the Shards into the Ember Activator you're turning them into raw Ember energy. That energy can be transferred by using Emitters, Relays and Receptors that you connect using the Hammer you made at the beginning",

  "To make Dawnstone, you first need to melt down Copper and Gold, either in a Smeltery or a Melter. You then need to transfer the Molten Copper and Gold to a Mixer to make Molten Dawnstone. The last step is to transfer that to a Stamper Base and using a Stamper 2 blocks above it, turn it into Dawnstone Ingots. All the listed machines use Ember to work, besides the Smeltery if you decided to take that route.",

  "Later on, you will need an Adhesive to make Empowered Enori Crystals. To make one you will need to get into the alchemical part of Embers. You will need an Exchanmge Tablet on which you place the items needed for the recipe on the corresponding sides, Alchemy Pedestals around it, on which you put the different Aspecti, a Beam Cannon filled with ember, facing the Exchange Tablet and a Cinder Plinth, which turns mundane materials into Ash Piles, when supplied with ember. How this recipe system works is, you fill up the pedestals that have the corresponding aspecti on them with a certain amount of Ash Piles, place the corresponding items on the Exchange Tablet and fire the Beam Cannon at it. If you fill the Pedestals with an incorrect amount of Ash Piles, you will get Alchemical Waste which tells you how close you were to the correct amount."
